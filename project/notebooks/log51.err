Data prefix:  /home/dhnchandan/anaconda3/envs/nb_md_analysis
Working dir:  /home/dhnchandan/Documents/cc/gromacs/nb_md_analysis/project/notebooks
Command line:
  gmx -nobackup -nocopyright mdrun -s 3HTB_JZ4_gppmd.tpr -o 3HTB_JZ4_md.trr -c 3HTB_JZ4_md.gro -e 3HTB_JZ4_md.edr -g 3HTB_JZ4_md.log -cpo 3HTB_JZ4_md.cpt

Compiled SIMD: SSE2, but for this host/run AVX2_128 might be better (see log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
