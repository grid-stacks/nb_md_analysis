NOTE 1 [file ligand.top, line 24863]:
  System has non-zero total charge: 5.999999
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Floating_Point_Arithmetic
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.
  



WARNING 1 [file ligand.top, line 24863]:
  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can
  lead to severe artifacts, such as ions moving into regions with low
  dielectric, due to the uniform background charge. We suggest to
  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.

Removing all charge groups because cutoff-scheme=Verlet
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 65091.00
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.18
